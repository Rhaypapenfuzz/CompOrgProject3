# CompOrgProject3
Working with recursion in assembly language(MIPS) to process userInput checked with several assignment conditions provided by instructor.
Starting from project 2, write a subprogram to convert a valid user input to a number. When doing the conversion, the subprogram needs to call itself.  When the subprogram is called (either by the main program or by itself), the input to convert needs to be passed into the subprogram with a stack. When the subprogram returns, the result of conversion (a number) should be stored in the stack and later be read from the stack by the caller.
The subprogram doing the conversion should not print the invalid base N number. That should be done in the main program.
